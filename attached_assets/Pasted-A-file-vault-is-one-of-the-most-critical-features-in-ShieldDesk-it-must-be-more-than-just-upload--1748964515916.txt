A file vault is one of the most critical features in ShieldDesk — it must be more than just “upload/download.” It must embody security, access control, auditability, and compliance.

Here’s a breakdown of the essential and advanced features a file vault should have:

✅ CORE FEATURES (MUST-HAVE)
1. 🔐 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Restrict file access by user roles (e.g., Admin, Legal, HR, IT).

Define view, download, upload, delete permissions.

Folder- or file-level access granularity.

2. 🧾 Audit Trail / Access Logs
Log every action (upload, view, delete, share).

Include user, timestamp, and IP/device metadata.

Exportable for compliance reporting (POPIA, GDPR, etc.).

3. 📤 Secure Upload & Download
AES-256 encryption at rest (on disk/S3)

TLS encryption in transit

Virus/malware scanning (optional for phase 2)

4. 📁 Folder Structure & Tagging
Allow clients to create folders or label documents (e.g., "HR", "Legal", "Compliance")

Enable search and filter by tag or filename

5. 🔗 Secure File Sharing
Generate expiring public/private links

Optional password protection or OTP-based access

View-only vs. download-enabled links

6. 🧑‍💼 Multi-User Collaboration
Support multiple internal users per client organization

Assign collaborators to files/folders

Track who’s responsible for what

7. 📊 Vault Usage Dashboard
Show storage used vs. available

8. 🧠 Smart Compliance Folders
Pre-defined folders for "POPIA", "SARS", "HR Policies", etc.

Auto-check for missing files (checklist style)

9. 🛡️ Digital Rights Management (DRM)
Prevent file download (view-only in-browser)

Watermark files with user info when downloaded

10. 🔔 Notifications & Alerts
Notify on:

New uploads

Set rules (e.g., "Notify me if legal folder accessed")

11. 🗃️ Version Control
Keep version history of documents

Roll back to previous version if needed

12. 📱 Mobile-Optimized Vault Access
Responsive UI for uploading/viewing files via phone

Especially useful for field workers or remote teams
